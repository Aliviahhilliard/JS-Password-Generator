# JavaScript: Password Generator Project

## My Task

```
This is about a JavaScript project where I've modified existing code to build a password generator tool. This tool creates random passwords for users based on what they want in the password, like special characters, numbers, and upper and lower case letters. 

The generated passwords can include special characters. If you're not familiar with these, check out this [list of password special characters](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters) from the OWASP Foundation.
```

## User Story

```
AS A developer with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```
##  Functionality

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special charcters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```
## Mock-Up

```
I've included a picture to show you what the tool looks like and how it should function:

```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
To check my work, a few things are being looked at like whether all the parts of the project are done, if the tool works without problems when used, if it's easy to use and looks clean, and whether my code is well-organized and easy to understand. 
```

## Review

```
I've included links to where you can see the tool in action, and the code behind it on GitHub. 

// * The URL of the deployed application.

// * The URL of the GitHub repository, with a unique name and a readme describing the project.
```
I hope this helps simplify the project for you!
